## iTerm is better than Terminal

* [Link to iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/features.html)

## Tips
* Problems seeing text in iTerm
  - Change Minimum contrast and it will make invisible text no so invisible

| Keyboard Shortcut      |    Value |
| :-------- | --------:|
| `ctrl` + `a`  | moves you to front of line |
| `ctrl` + `e`     |   moves you to end of line |
| `ctrl` + `u`    |    clears line (oh-my-zsh) |

* To speed up in Preferences - GENERAL uncheck GPU rendering and it will speed up iTerm a ton
* To split window: `cmd` + `d` 
* Dim others except focused window
  - This is great if your workflow involves using multiple terminal windows open at one time
* High contrast tab
  - Makes you see active tab better
* Hide from command tab switch and dock
  - I like this because I use `esc` to toggle iTerm
* Multiple windows
* You can open preferences and under tab choose
  - Light (High Contrast)
* Increase dimming (to help show active terminal)
* Check dim inactive split panes
* Check dim background windows
  - This will help make sure your current terminal is easily seen)
